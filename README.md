# Learning Python, Numpy and Deep Learning

> These are my Jupyter notebooks with my in-progress experiment of learning **Python**, datascience and deep learning.

> Ultimate goal: create new deep network architectures using Keras and use them in revolutionary mobile apps that will change the way we perceive reality and man's purpose on earth (_I'm **obviously** joking here, capisce?_)

1. start with [Day1](Day1.ipynb) file to see what I learned on my first day of using Jupyter, pandas and numpy.

2. then go to [Day2](Day2.ipynb) file...
